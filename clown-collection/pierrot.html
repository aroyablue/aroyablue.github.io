Pierrots are  one of the delicate breeds of clowns and more on the smaller size. Unlike their clown counterparts, they are coldblooded and require an abundance of heat.  The caps on top of the Pierrot’s head is not a fashion statement. That is a part of their body and is required for them to gather heat. DO NOT TRIM THE CAPS OF PIERROTS. They are not for first-time owner and require higher levels of understandings.

<h3>Diet</h3>
A Pierrot’s diet consist of delicate foods. This includes, cotton candy, . While they are capable of eating meats, it is highly advised to obstain from giving them it as they will resent you from the bad taste. 
<br>
<br>
<h3>Housing and Temperment:</h3> 
Given a Pierrot’s appearance, they fancy monochromatic tents. They’re not an outside breed and tend to enjy film noirs and other cinematic pieces. Make sure that these have acess to things like cinemas or projectors. While not entirely solitary, these clowns do not mesh entirely with all clown personalities. If you are going to put them with other clowns, we advise to keep them around Other Pierrots, Mimes or Jesters.
