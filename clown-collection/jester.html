Jesters are the descendents of the now extinct court jesters. This lineage makes them highly valuable in preservation as well as pricing. They are seen as one of the most expensive clown breeds to have. They can easily be recognized by the headwear they donn.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Diet</h3>
Since Jesters are more closely tied to their heritage, it is crucial for them to remain in touch with this in any means possible. A Jester's diet consist of European foods from the medieval era. These mostly contain fruits like dates and figs, but they are also capable of eating mince pies. Jesters do not need to eat as often as other clowns as it is a gene passed down from their ancestors. We advise clown owners to feed their jesters once a day as to reduce the risk of overfeeding.

<br>
<h3>Housing and Temperment</h3>
Being a traditional clown, they require a traditional home. While not everyone has millions of dollars to buy them their own theater or even a medieval castle, a medieval-style circus tent will suffice. This breed requires play time and therefore, they need toys and items that remind them of a renaissance faire. On a related note to their playfulness, they are extremely sociable creatures. They are best social when it comes to adults and other jesters, but they can be trained to interact with other clowns.
