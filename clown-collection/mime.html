<div class="info">
Mimes are the most silent of the clown species. Baring a shared ancestry to Harlequins and Pierrots, Mimes are genuinely one of the first stepping stones into more complex and high-maintenace breeds.  
<br>
<br>
<h3>Diet</h3>
A Mimeâ€™s diet consist of sweet treats, but be careful as to not give them treats that are high in sugar. Though it is needed for their survival, Mimes do best when their food is lower in sugar. The same can be said about how the treats are made. It is advised not to feed your Mimes store bought goods as it will upset their stomach. As a substitute, we suggest to offer them baked treats as it will be more beneficial to their health.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Housing and Temperment</h3> 
Mimes are not as social as the more energetic breeds. They require solitude and space not only to relaax, but also to practice their invisible item tricks. Mimes are pack animals and would do well if grouped with other mimes.
